Syntax Sugar:
1. IN and ANY clause. Index not used with =ANY() but used with IN clause. ANY construct is far more versatile, as it can be combined with various operators, not just =. Example for LIKE:
	SELECT 'foo' LIKE ANY('{FOO,bar,%oo%}');

  Second Form 
	WHERE (a,b) = ANY(VALUES (1,1),(1,2));
		OR
	WHERE (a,b) IN (VALUES (1,1),(1,2));
